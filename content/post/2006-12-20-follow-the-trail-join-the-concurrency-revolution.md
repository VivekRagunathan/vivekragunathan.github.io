    I could not stop writing this post after I read <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/guest-ed-200609.htm">this</a> article by Herb Sutter. The article is just a casual technical discussion but very encouraging that a person requires at the right time &#8211; the time when he is a student. Even after several years after my college, I have been trying to keep myself a student and I got a right encouragement to join the Concurrency revolution. Thanks to Herb Sutter.

    As Albert Einstein, Robert Goddard, and Wernher von Braun walked the trail of Galileo and Newton , I will to walk the trail of some of the contemporary people like Sutter, Stroustoup, Don Box, Richter and others.
