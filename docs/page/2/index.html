          <p>I am very particular in composing the content of the posts (and pages) on this blog. By content, I mean what I literally put in the post/page while editing – text, image, HTML etc. I like to keep the content extremely clean and avoid polluting with HTML like I had to earlier (on blogspot). With the content polluted, it is a terrible pain when migrating blogs and/or rendering the posts flawless and consistent across browsers. <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> is notorious in that aspect 1.</p>

<p>The Mamallapuram Shore Temple, constructed on the deep southern shores of the Bay of Bengal, is one of the oldest stone structures on the planet. It was built around the beginning of the Anno Domini (AD). The site consists of three temple structures, subsidiary structures, and statues primarily built with granite. Prominent statues are that of a lion and elephant with great significance in the way it was rock-cut. Chariots are the primary subsidiary structures other than the temple. It is inevitable not to be marveled at the temple design, intricate and precise carvings and inscriptions. Carvings are made on a monolithic rock on which the works of an elephant and its ear with its loose skin are nearly impossible even today. Inscriptions, according to linguists, is poetic and metaphorical, a sophisticated language nevertheless. Another marvel is Krishna’s Butter Ball, a massive boulder of rock sitting tight above a rocky slope.</p>

          <p>It was about a decade ago when <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ezd0y49a.aspx">Visual Studio .NET 2002</a> was launched. Having worked with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms950418.aspx">Visual Studio 6</a> until then, the new interface was refreshing and powerful along with .NET and the suite of languages, tools and technologies. If you were there, you would have felt <em>times were changing</em>. Beyond the cool and modern interface, Visual Studio <strong>.NET</strong> 2002 had a lot more to offer compared to Visual Studio 6 — .NET. It was an exciting time for me back then.</p>

          <p>If you are writing a typical console based application in Windows, you would end up with an executable (exe). You might also have one or more dependent libraries (DLL). The question is where do we place these DLLs so that they are picked up at runtime by the application; loaded and consumed. Actually it is no brainer, just put them along side the console application executable. Or you could place the DLLs in the <em>System32</em> directory. Or you could add the directory to the <em>PATH</em>. Well, my point was actually to say that the DLLs can be simply placed alongside the executable and it would be picked up.</p>

          <p>It all began when I wanted to return more than one value from one of the methods. Although my attempts ended futile, it was fun exploring and musing how things could have been.</p>
<p>There are at least a couple of options to return multiple values from a method:-</p>
<ol>
<li>return an instance of a class that holds the values</li>
<li>return a tuple</li>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a> – Inversion of control, is a design that enables fluid flow of control by decoupling tight dependencies between the portion of a code that exhibits behavior and another portion of code that provides required functionality. One form of IoC, as we know, is Dependency Injection (DI). For instance, a <code>TextEditor</code> could refer an <code>ISpellChecker</code> instead of direct coupling to a specific implementation of spell checker thereby enabling the text editor to switch spell checker or even use more than one.</p>
